Final Paper for CMPT 726, the summary of the paper is as follows:
1) We trained and hypertuned a model to detect facial landmarks.
2) We created models which were significantly less complex than the industry standard and still provided a very reasonable sum of squared errors.
3) Our model could be used on low power devices such as mobile phones.
4) We then used our model in a practical appication of Facial Swapping (in static pics and also in live-videos).
